# Hello-World
Just another repository

Hi Humans!

Hubot here, I like Node.js and Coffeescript (that's what I'm made of!).
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Commits are pretty glorious, because a bunch of them together read like the history of your project.

Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Thanks to these messages, you and others can read through commits and understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
